							Some instructions before using the software.


								IMAGE STEGANOGRAPHY


1) Please maintain a ratio of 1:30 atleast between (resolution wise) the cover image & hide image respectively for best results.
2) The cover image should not be much contrasting with respect to the hide image.
3) If the error message "Image to large to hide " is displayed try resizing the image.
4) Use high resolution cover images preferably full HD(1920*1080) quad HD (2560*1440) and higher.
5) The alphanumeric key generated at the end of encoding is very important as it is used again whilst decoding, an incorrect key used during decoding may result in program termination.
6) Do not use social networking platforms or messengers to send the encoded image they tamper with the image and the hidden message/image is lost in the process.
